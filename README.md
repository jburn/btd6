# btd6
This started out as an attempt to determine what the hit boxes for each tower in Bloons Tower Defense 6 were, but eventually became a script for placing perfectly tesselated tower grids of any tower type, as well as automating various processes such as upgrading and tower selling / etc. Could most likely be used to automate a btd6 race but I'll leave that to someone else for testing.

## Examples
